### **Link to live demo**
---
Follow [this link](https://budgetbuddyapp.netlify.app/) üêá to check a working App demo.

The Frontend Build is being hosted at Netlify while the Backend (PostgreSQL database included) at Heroku.

### UX Screencaps
---
If you want to quickly check the UI and UX key features of this App, please take a look at the screen captures below.

#### **Loading components:**
As the Backend and DataBase are hosted at Heroku, it is possible you have to wait until the Dynos wake up.

### **Notes for Local deployment**
---
In case you want to use this repo locally, here are some caveats that hopefully will smooth the process üòÖ

**Proxy:** Search on the package.json file for the Frontend code and change it to localhost:5000 (or the port you are using for Node.js locally)

**DataBase:** Search on the Backend code for index.js inside *the DB folder*. There you can uncomment/comment blocks of code for connecting locally to a database.
This proyect uses Postgres but you can quickly adapt it to another relational db of your choice.

For a remote connection to the hosted database a URI approach is used. You can replace with your own in the *config.env* file inside the *config* folder or where you manage the enviroment variables.

### Database Schema
---
Checkout the file *database.sql* inside the *db folder* on the backend code to have an idea / get SQL commands that may help you re-create the database locally.

If you are a visual learner, the graph below could be of better help:

#### **Nice to have features:**
There is so much to learn and implement that I decided to keep a checklist althought looking at it is overwhelming üò¨

- [ ] A more semantic HTML
- [ ] Subtle animations and cool microinteractions
- [ ] More types of graphs to better analize the data
- [ ] ORM Model DB, types and validation (could it be Sequelize?)
- [ ] Multiple users, Login Auth (JWT?)
- [ ] Add and manage new categories
- [ ] More records filtering options (date, categories)
- [ ] PWA - serviceworker
- [ ] Unit testing
