## **Link to live demo**
---
Follow [this link](https://budgetbuddyapp.netlify.app/) üêá to check a working App demo.

The Frontend Build is being hosted at Netlify while the Backend is hosted at Heroku (PostgreSQL DataBase included)

## App Screen captures
---
If you want to quickly check the UI and UX key features of this App, please take a look at the screen captures below.

#### **Loading components:**
As the Backend and DataBase are hosted at Heroku, it is possible that you have to wait until the Dynos wake up.

$~$

$~$

#### **Adding a new record:**
There are two types of records you can add > money you *earn* or money you *spend*.

#### **Updating a record:**
It is possible to edit a previous record but *the type* of record.

## **Responsive features**

**Adding a New Record:**
On mobile phones with shorter screens the *erase/reset entered data button* gets hidden.

**Record Description:**
On mobile phones with narrower screens, *larger record descriptions* get truncated and displays 3 dots.

On Tablets and Desktop the Navigation Bar change its possition for a better landscape configuration.

## **Notes for local deployment**
---
In case you want to use this repository locally, here are some caveats that hopefully will smooth the process üòÖ

**Proxy:**
Search in the *package.json* file for the Frontend code and change the proxy to localhost:5000 (or the port you are using for Node.js locally)

**DataBase:**
Search in the Backend code for the file *index.js* inside the *DB folder*. There you can uncomment/comment blocks of code for connecting locally to a database.
This project uses Postgres but you can quickly adapt it to use another relational database of your choice.

For a remote connection to a hosted database an URI approach is used. You can replace it with your own in the *config.env* file inside the *config* folder (or where you manage the enviroment variables)

$~$

$~$

## Database Schema
---
Checkout the file *database.sql* inside the *db folder* on the Backend code to have an idea and get SQL commands that may help you re-create the database locally.

If you are a visual learner, the graph below could be of better help:

## **Nice to have features**
---
There is so much to learn and implement that I decided to keep a checklist -althought looking at it is overwhelming üò¨

- [X] Write a readme to the repo :)
- [ ] A more semantic HTML
- [ ] Subtle animations and cool microinteractions
- [ ] More types of graphs to better analize the data
- [ ] ORM Model DB, types and validation (could it be Sequelize?)
- [ ] Multiple users, Login Auth (JWT?)
- [ ] Add and manage new categories
- [ ] More records filtering options (date, categories)
- [ ] PWA - serviceworker
- [ ] Unit testing
